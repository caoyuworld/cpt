# Combinatory Process Theory (CPT)

**Version 1.0 | April 2025**

This repository contains the official release of *Combinatory Process Theory: A Structural Model of World Generation*, authored by Yu Cao.

CPT is a generative, recursive, and structurally grounded world modeling framework. It redefines the world not as a static entity system, but as a process composed through five axioms:
- **Combinability**
- **Hierarchical Generation**
- **Recursive Participation**
- **Structural Coherence**
- **Emergence**

The current release (v1.0) marks the **P0 Stage**, focusing on theoretical foundations and transdisciplinary applications across AI, ethics, and systems design.
