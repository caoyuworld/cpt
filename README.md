# Combinatory Process Theory (CPT)

**Version 1.0 | April 2025**  
**SSRN Preprint ID: [5224136](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5224136)**

> *Combinatory Process Theory* (CPT) is an original theory of world modeling that redefines the world not as a static system of entities, but as a structurally recursive, combinatorially generated process. This repository contains the officially released v1.0 of CPT, marking the P0 phase of the theory's development roadmap.

## 🔷 What is CPT?

CPT introduces a generative, structural foundation for understanding how the world, consciousness, and ethics arise. It is based on five foundational axioms:

1. **Combinability** – The universe is built through combinatory units, not fixed entities.  
2. **Hierarchical Generation** – All systems emerge in layers, recursively nested.  
3. **Recursive Participation** – Components participate in generating new structures.  
4. **Structural Coherence** – Stability is defined by internal consistency across levels.  
5. **Emergent Generation** – Novelty arises through structural recursion, not randomness.
